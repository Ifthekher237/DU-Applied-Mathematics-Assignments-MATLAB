Welcome to the repository containing solved assignments for 4th-year students of the Applied Mathematics department at Dhaka University. These assignments are implemented in MATLAB and serve as practical exercises for various mathematical concepts.

## Assignments Overview

- **Visualization and analysis of mathematical functions**: Includes polar plots, 3D surfaces, and contour plots.

- **Solving ordinary and partial differential equations**: Using MATLAB's DSolve and NDSolve, and visualizing the solutions.

- **Parametric solutions**: Such as parametric curves and parametric equations for ecological models.

- **Linear algebra and optimization problems**: Including transportation problems and assignment problems.

- **Population modeling**: Covers population growth, logistic equations, and predator-prey models.

- **Epidemiology modeling**: Explores SIR and SIS models for infectious diseases.

- **Analysis of autonomous systems**: Including vector fields, nullclines, and equilibrium points.

## Usage

Each assignment is organized into separate folders within this repository. You can navigate to each assignment's folder to find MATLAB scripts and code solutions. Feel free to explore, use, and learn from these assignments for your educational purposes.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions and improvements from students and the broader community. If you have any suggestions, corrections, or additional assignments to share, please submit a pull request.
